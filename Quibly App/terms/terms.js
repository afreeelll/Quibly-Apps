      We help people understand long documents more quickly and easily. Seeing the need for concise yet accurate information, we were inspired to build an AI model capable of automatic summarization. With the additional feature of searching for similar documents, we hope this web not only summarizes but also enriches users' insights effectively. This idea was born from discussions and a desire to provide a real solution amidst the overwhelming flow of information today.
